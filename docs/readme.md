# Docs conventions

## Goals
- Keep repository README short; put deep technical detail here.
- One doc = one question answered.
- Prefer diagrams and examples over long prose.

## Structure
- Architecture and pipelines: `docs/architecture/`
- Research methodology and constraints: `docs/research/`
- Reporting and dashboards: `docs/reporting/`
- Developer workflows: `docs/dev/`

## Diagrams
Use Mermaid diagrams where possible. 
Keep README diagrams short and place full flows in `docs/architecture/pipelines.md`.
